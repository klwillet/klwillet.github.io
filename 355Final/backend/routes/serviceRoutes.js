// Import the `protect` middleware from authMiddleware.js
// `protect` runs BEFORE the controller on any route it's applied to.
// It validates the incoming JWT from the Authorization header, decodes the user ID,
// fetches that user from the DB, and attaches them to req.user.
// If the token is missing, expired, or invalid — it rejects the request with a 401
// and the controller function never runs.
// Please look into this code (../middleware/authMiddleware)

// GET  /api/services/  → protect runs first, then getServices (returns all services for req.user)
// POST /api/services/  → protect runs first, then setService  (creates a service owned by req.user)

// PUT    /api/services/:id → protect runs first, then updateService (edits service with matching :id)
// DELETE /api/services/:id → protect runs first, then deleteService (removes service with matching :id)
// :id is a URL parameter accessible in the controller via req.params.id

router.route('/:id').put(protect, updateService).delete(protect, deleteService)

// Export this router so server.js can mount it:
// app.use('/api/services', require('./routes/serviceRoutes'))
